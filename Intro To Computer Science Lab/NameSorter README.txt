The java file NameSorter.java, when compiled, allows for one CMD (command prompt) argument.

The CMD argument available to give, which enables some control as to how program runs, is the following:

userInsight-TRUE

The CMD argument must be copied exactly as shown in this read me file. In this case, all the argument enables is 
showing the names after two processes to make the data uniform - trim unnecessary spaces and reduce all strings to 
strictly lowercase letters

If the program user wishes to enable this small feature, in the command prompt, compile the program first

Command to compile the program in CMD:

		javac NameSorter.java

Afterwards, to run the program normally without the feature, type into CMD:

		java NameSorter

To run program with the feature mentioned avobe, type into CMD:

		java NameSorter userInsigh-TRUE


In order for these steps to work, current working directory of the CMD must be the same folder containing the JAVA and CLASS files.
